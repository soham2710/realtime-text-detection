# Real-Time Text Detection with Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract

**Overview:**

This project demonstrates real-time text detection using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract. It captures video from your webcam or screen, processes the frames to detect text, and displays the recognized text on the screen in green color. The background is optionally blurred to emphasize the text.

**Prerequisites:**

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Tesseract OCR
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)

Ensure that you download and install Tesseract OCR and set the path to the Tesseract executable in the code.

**How to Run:**

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.

2. Open the Python script in your preferred code editor.

3. Set the path to the Tesseract executable (`pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd`) to the location of your Tesseract installation.

4. Customize any other settings, such as webcam resolution, blur parameters, or text display position in the code as needed.

5. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python real_time_text_detection.py
    ```

The webcam or screen video feed will be displayed, and the recognized text will be overlaid in green color. Press 'q' to exit the program.

**Features:**

- Real-time text detection from webcam or screen.
- Display recognized text in green color.
- Optional background blurring to emphasize the text.

**Customization:**

You can customize the project by adjusting various parameters in the code, such as blur settings, text overlay position, and more, to suit your specific requirements.
